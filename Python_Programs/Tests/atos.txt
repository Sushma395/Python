Finding sum of digits of a number until sum becomes single digit.

Given a number n, we need to find the sum of its digits such that:

If n < 10 digSum(n) = n Else digSum(n) = Sum(digSum(n)) Examples :

Input : 1234 Output : 1 Explanation : The sum of 1+2+3+4 = 10, digSum(x) == 10 Hence ans will be 1+0 = 1

Input : 5674 Output : 4
